[ 1 ] We present here a detailed investigation of the mesospheric temperature structure over
Taiwan, a subtropical location, using 9 years of observations (March 2002 to October
2010) by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry
(SABER) instrument onboard the Thermosphere‐Ionosphere‐Mesosphere Energetics and
Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. The mesopause (MP) is always found to be located at a
higher level with a mean altitude of 98.2 ± 1.8 km and mean temperature of 165.0 ± 5.8 K.
The climatological study shows that MP is lower and warmer during summer and
higher and cooler during winter, which is different from the midlatitudes and high latitudes
as well as from low latitudes. The temperatures of the mesospheric temperature inversions
(MTI) and secondary minimum (SM), on the other hand, are lower during summer and
higher during winter, and their altitudes do not show any annual variation. It is found
that the thermal structure over Taiwan undergoes a phase shift between 89 and 95 km, and
above this region it is in phase with the solar flux. Since MP is always above these
altitudes, it shows a seasonal variation that is in phase with the solar energy inputs, and the
temperatures below (that of MTI and SM) show the opposite seasonal variation caused by
mesospheric adiabatic cooling and warming processes.

1. Introduction
[ 2 ] The mesosphere, which extends from approximately
50 to 100 km, exhibits many interesting phenomena and
hence is a very intriguing region of the atmosphere. Primary
heating and cooling mechanisms of the mesosphere are
mostly in nonlocal thermodynamical equilibrium. Heat input
to the mesosphere is through direct solar radiation, chemical
heating from exothermic reactions and by collisional
quenching. The cooling of mesosphere is through radiative
processes, primarily, the infrared emission from CO 2 (at 15 mm),
ozone and water vapor. The mesospheric energy budget is
also influenced by dynamics through gravity wave breaking,
turbulence and adiabatic compressional heating due to vertical
motions. Excellent reviews of the subject are available in
the literature [Lindzen, 1981; Garcia and Solomon, 1985;
Hauchecorne et al., 1987; Mlynczak and Solomon, 1991a, 1991b,
1993; Roble, 1995; Killeen and Johnsson, 1995; Meriwether
and Mlynczak, 1995; Beig et al., 2003].
[ 3 ] Although the mesosphere is located well above the
Earth’s surface, its structure can be altered by human
activities. Imprints of such changes can be clearly seen in
mesospheric chemical composition and temperature. It is
difficult to quantify the mesospheric variability due to these

effects because of the presence of the much stronger natural
sources of variabilities, namely, the seasonal, annual, and
solar cycle variations.
[ 4 ] The accurate measurement of mesospheric temperature
is a challenging problem. Although, a number of methods
have been used for temperature measurement, each of these
has some merits as well as disadvantages. Some of these
methods are hydroxyl airglow, Rayleigh lidar, Na and K
lidars, rocket grenades, falling spheres, etc. [Lübken and von
Zahn, 1991; Keckhut et al., 1995; Whiteway et al., 1995; von
Zahn et al., 1996; She and von Zahn, 1998; Leblanc et al.,
1998; She et al., 2000; Lübken and Mullemann, 2003; Beig
et al., 2003; Chu et al., 2005; Beig, 2006]. All these methods
are limited to certain local times and particular locations
over the land. A large number of these studies pertain to the
Northern Hemisphere and less to the Southern Hemisphere.
Also, most of these were for midlatitudes and high latitudes.
On the other hand, satellite observations provide a global
picture, thereby enabling one to understand the mesosphere
and its morphology as a whole [Thulasiraman and Nee,
2002; Shepherd et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2007; Kishore Kumar
et al., 2008; Venkat Ratnam et al., 2010]. Using daytime
zonally averaged temperatures from the Wind Imaging
Interferometer (WINDII) instrument onboard the Upper
Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) for the period 1991–
1997, the global variability of mesospheric temperature was
investigated in detail at three altitudes: 75, 82 and 87 km
[Shepherd et al., 2004]. A strong semiannual oscillation in
equatorial and tropical latitudes and dominant annual (winter
maximum and summer minimum), 90 day and 60 day

oscillations in midlatitudes and high latitudes were observed.
A quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO) was also observed
extending from 45°S to 65°N.
[ 5 ] The mesopause (hereinafter referred to as MP), now
considered more as a region than a layer [Beig et al., 2003],
is the coldest part of the atmosphere. Using shipborne lidar
measurements during April–July 1996, von Zahn et al.
[1996] showed that there are two distinct levels of MP
altitude on the global scale and that MP was lower (86 ± 3 km)
and cooler (150–170 K) in the northern midlatitudes and high
latitudes and higher (100 ± 3 km) and warmer (160–190 K)
at the other latitudes. Investigation of temperature data for
MP characteristics from the High Resolution Doppler
Imager (HRDI) instrument onboard the UARS satellite also
revealed a lower and cooler MP during summer and a higher
and warmer MP in winter [Thulasiraman and Nee, 2002;
Venkat Ratnam et al., 2004]. Xu et al. [2007] also got the
same results for MP characteristics using the observations
of the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband
Emission Radiometry (SABER) onboard the Thermosphere‐
Ionosphere‐Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED)
satellite during 2002–2006. The switch over from the
summer‐type MP to the winter‐type MP takes place in
30°–40° latitude. In addition, MP characteristics are also
strongly modulated by the diurnal and the semidiurnal tides
at all latitudes. Many ground‐based measurements from
midlatitudes and high latitudes also showed the presence of
the two‐level MP [Leblanc et al., 1998; She and von Zahn,
1998; States and Gardner, 2000; She et al., 2000]. At the
equator and tropical latitudes, MP is at the higher altitude
during all seasons with no significant variations [Xu et al.,
2007; Kishore Kumar et al., 2008; Venkat Ratnam et al.,
2010].
[ 6 ] The mesospheric inversion layer or the mesospheric
temperature inversion (hereinafter called MTI), first
observed by Schmidlin [1976] in temperature profiles mea-
sured using falling spheres and acoustic grenades, is another
interesting phenomenon in the mesosphere [Meriwether and
Gardner, 2000]. In low latitudes and midlatitudes MTIs
were observed with great regularity in both upper meso-
sphere (60–70 km) and the MP region (90–100 km).
Majority of the studies on MTIs have been conducted from
midlatitudes based on Rayleigh and Na lidar measurements
[Hauchecorne et al., 1987; Whiteway et al., 1995; Leblanc and
Hauchecorne, 1997; She et al., 2000; States and Gardner,
2000; Chu et al., 2005, etc.] and a few studies from the low
latitudes [Siva Kumar et al., 2001; Venkat Ratnam et al., 2002].
Using the measurements from two midlatitude stations in
France, Observatoire de Haute‐Provence (OHP, 44°N, 5°E)
and Centre d’Essais des Landes (CEL, 44°N, 1°W),
Hauchecorne et al. [1987] showed that the altitude of MTI
has an annual variation occurring in 70–83 km during
summer and at further lower altitudes during winter. The
altitude of the secondary minimum, which is the temperature
minimum below the inversion layer (following the termi-
nology of Hauchecorne et al. [1987] and hereinafter referred
to as SM), also follows an annual variation.
[ 7 ] Studies on mesospheric temperature structure over
subtropical latitudes have been very few. Using Na lidar
measurements Clemesha et al. [1999] showed that MP
temperature and altitude over a subtropical station, Sao Jose
D00P06
dos Campos (23°S, 46°W), Brazil, during July to October
1998 were 190 K and 103 km, respectively. Leblanc et al.
[1998] showed from Rayleigh lidar measurements over
Mauna Loa (MLO; 19.5°N, 155.6°W), Hawaii that the
mesosphere follows a semiannual cycle under the influence
of the equatorial dynamics and is also modulated by the
midlatitude annual cycle. Friedman and Chu [2007] dis-
cussed the seasonal variations of the nocturnal thermal
structure of the mesosphere over Arecibo observatory
(18.35°N, 66.75°W) using K lidar measurements. All these
studies pertain to the nighttime and thus carry tidal sig-
natures. A proper diurnal averaging is very important to
understand accurately the seasonal variations and climato-
logical features of the mesospheric thermal structure. Such
an opportunity is provided by satellite measurements. In
addition, a long database will enhance the statistical sig-
nificance of the climatology. The present study aims to
bridge the gap between the current understanding of
mesosphere over low latitudes and that over midlatitudes
and high latitudes by investigating the temperature structure
of mesosphere over Taiwan (centered at 24°N, 121°E), a
subtropical region in the Northern Hemisphere. We have
used the temperature data retrieved from the measurements
of the SABER instrument to investigate in complete detail
the climatology and other long‐period variations in the alti-
tudes and temperatures of MP, MTI, SM, and the subtropical
mesosphere in general.
2. Data and Analysis
[ 8 ] The TIMED satellite was launched in December 2001
in a Sun‐synchronous polar orbit at 625 km with an incli-
nation of 74.1°. The satellite makes ∼15 orbits per day with
a period of 1.6 h and takes 60 days to complete a full
24 h cycle in local time. SABER is one of the four instru-
ments on the TIMED satellite whose aim is to advance the
understanding of the structure, energetics, chemistry and
dynamics of the atmosphere from 20 to 120 km. SABER
measures the Earth limb emissions in 10 broadband radi-
ometer channels ranging from 1.27 mm to 17 mm. The
kinetic temperature from the tropopause to the lower ther-
mosphere is retrieved from CO 2 15 mm limb emission using
a full nonlocal thermal equilibrium (non‐LTE) inversion
method [Mertens et al., 2001, 2004].
[ 9 ] In the present study we have used the SABER 2A
level data product of version 1.07 from March 2002 to
October 2010, a little less than 9 years of data. To investigate
the mesosphere over Taiwan, we considered a latitude‐
longitude grid of 6° × 4° covering 21°N–27°N and 119°E–
123°E region. Figure 1 shows a map of Taiwan and highlights
the region of interest in the present study by a thick black box.
[ 10 ] Mertens et al. [2001] have documented the retrieval
uncertainties to be 1.4 K at 80 km, 7.8 K at 100 km and
22.5 K at 110 km for the early versions of the temperature
data from the SABER instrument. Remsberg et al. [2008]
have shown from their comparison of the latest 1.07 ver-
sion temperatures with other ground‐based observations that
the error was within about ±5 K and concluded that the
temperatures of this version, in the upper mesosphere and
lower thermosphere region, are of good quality. Considering
the errors in the non‐LTE parameters, García‐Comas et al.
[2008] showed that the overall error in these temperatures is

around ±1–2 K below 95 km and ±4 K at 100 km. The errors
are larger when the temperature profiles have pronounced
vertical structure, i.e., strong temperature inversion layers,
and can rise up to ±3 K around 80 km and ±8 K at 90 km.
The vertical resolution of the SABER temperature profiles is
∼2 km [Mertens et al., 2004].
[ 11 ] Each individual SABER temperature profile is
smoothed using Chebeshyv polynomials with a cut off
wavelength of 4 km to remove the short‐scale gravity wave
features and for the accurate identification of MP, MTI, and
SM. The temperatures and altitudes of MP, MTI and SM are
identified from each profile and the climatological proper-
ties investigated. SABER takes 60 days to cover all local
times at a particular location. However, observations around
local noon are mostly absent. The temperatures and altitudes
of MP, MTI, and SM of every 2 months are sorted in local
time and a least squares fit for 24, 12 and 8 h harmonics is
performed. The constants obtained from these fits are used
to compute the diurnal series for every 2 months and aver-
aged to obtain the bimonthly mean temperatures and alti-
tudes. This process removes the tidal effects, but the effects
of planetary‐scale waves may still exist in the averages.
Similarly, to investigate the mesospheric temperature
structure, the temperature profiles of every 2 months are
sorted in local time and a least squares fit for 24, 12 and 8 h
harmonics is performed at each altitude level. The constants
obtained from these fits are used to compute the diurnal
temperature series for every 2 months and averaged to
obtain the bimonthly mean profile. The months are grouped
as JF (January–February), MA (March–April), MJ (May–
June), JA (July–August), SO (September–October), and ND
(November–December). Since we are interested in the long‐
period variations and the climatological behavior of the
mesospheric temperature structure over Taiwan, sorting the
data at finer temporal scales is not required. Figure 2 shows
a histogram of the number of temperature profiles available in
the Taiwan grid during the bimonthly periods from March
2002 to October 2010. The total number of profiles available
is 1874 and the average number of profiles is 36 per 2 months.
[ 12 ] A harmonic analysis is also performed on the alti-
tudes and temperatures of MP, MTI and SM using the con-
tinuous wavelet transform (CWT) [Farge, 1992; Torrence
and Compo, 1998] and the fast Fourier transform (FFT).
Spectral analysis tools are very important in understanding
the periodic variations of different parameters in observa-
tional sciences. The most popular till date is the FFT, which
is useful for spectral analysis of linear and stationary data.
However, seldom are geophysical data sets linear and
stationary. The wavelet transform provides an advancement
as it is capable of analyzing nonstationary data and gives time‐
frequency localization [Farge, 1992; Torrence and Compo,
1998]. The wavelet transform, relative to some basic
wavelet, provides a flexible time frequency window which
automatically narrows when observing high‐frequency com-
ponents and widens when observing low‐frequency compo-
nents. The technique of using wavelets to identify localized
power events in time series is now being used and applied in
various geophysical studies [e.g., Das and Sinha, 2008; Das
et al., 2009].
[ 13 ] For a discrete equally spaced time series x n (like in
the data set used in the present study), where n = 0, 1, ...
N − 1 is the index in time, the convolution of x n with a
scaled and translated version of y gives the continuous
wavelet transform:
W n ð s Þ 1⁄4
N 1

[ 14 ] By varying the wavelet scale s and translating along
the localized time index n, the wavelet coefficients can be
computed. The wavelet power spectrum, also called spec-
trogram, is defined as ∣W n (s)∣ 2 . The software written in IDL,
provided by Torrence and Compo [1998] is used in the
present analysis. The Morlet wavelet, which is a plane wave

[1992] and Torrence and Compo [1998].

Variations

[ 15 ] Each individual temperature profile available in the
Taiwan grid is investigated to identify MP, MTI, and SM.
Figure 3 shows a scatterplot of the altitude versus temper-
ature of these three features. MP is identified from all the
available 1874 temperature profiles and Figure 3a shows
that most of the MPs are concentrated around 100 km,
although there is a large variation in the temperature. The
MPs at other altitudes are less in number and the variation
in temperature is also low. There is no correlation between
the altitude and temperature of MP (correlation coefficient,
R = −0.04). For the identification of SM and MTI in the
individual profiles, we used the definition of Hauchecorne
et al. [1987], according to which, it is considered that an
inversion layer exists if the increase above the secondary
minimum is greater than 10 K. With this criterion, only
1483 profiles, spread almost uniformly over the 9 year
period under study, showed the presence of an MTI and a
corresponding SM. Figure 3b shows the distribution of the
MTI altitude versus temperature. It can be seen that the
MTIs are spread over a wide range of altitudes from 70 to
100 km and temperatures from 180 to 240 K and the overall
correlation between MTI altitude and the temperature is very
low (R = −0.14). Figure 3c shows the same for SM and it
can be seen that the distribution is confined to higher tem-
peratures at lower altitudes and vice versa. The correlation
coefficient between the altitude of SM and the temperature
is −0.61, showing a strong anticorrelation in comparison to
that of MP and MTI. This could be due to the simple fact
that the average lapse rate in the mesosphere is positive and
one finds higher temperatures at lower altitudes. However,
there are many factors contributing to the formation and
sustenance of these features in the mesosphere [Lindzen,
1981; Hauchecorne et al., 1987; Meriwether and Mlynczak,
1995; Meriwether and Gardner, 2000].
[ 16 ] Bimonthly mean altitudes and temperatures are
computed using the procedure described in section 2. The
mean MP altitude and temperature during the study period
are 98.2 ± 1.8 km and 165.0 ± 5.8 K, respectively. The mean
MTI and SM altitudes are 87.0 ± 2.2 km and 80.0 ± 2.0 km,
respectively, showing that the MTIs are occurring mostly at
the higher altitudes over Taiwan. The mean MTI and SM
temperatures are 207.0 ± 3.8 K and 184.9 ± 4.0 K, respec-
tively. The bimonthly mean altitudes and temperatures of
MP, MTI, and SM showed significant seasonal variations
and were subjected to the continuous wavelet transform.
A linear regression line was first subtracted from each data
series to remove the DC component and normalized to the
standard deviation of the same. The CWT, described earlier,
was applied to each of them. Figure 4 (left) shows the wavelet
spectrograms of the altitudes and those of the temperatures
are shown in Figure 4 (right). In Figure 4, the top, middle,
and bottom plots are for MP, MTI, and SM, respectively. The
solid and the dotted contours around the high‐power islands
are the 95% and the 80% confidence levels, respectively. The
thick solid black line is the “cone of influence” beyond
which the wavelet coefficients are subject to errors due to

therefore, not discussed hereinafter. The vertical plot beside
each spectrogram shows the global power spectrum (solid
circles), which is the time‐averaged wavelet power, and also
the Fourier power spectrum (stars) of the corresponding data
series. The 95% and the 80% confidence levels are shown in
the vertical plots in Figure 4 also by solid and dotted lines,
respectively.
[ 17 ] The wavelet spectrogram of MP altitude shows a
statistically significant annual variation from 2002 to 2006.
The global power spectrum and the Fourier spectrum also
show that there is a significant annual variation in MP

altitude and the average amplitude of variation is ±1.5 km.
An investigation of the phases shows that the altitude is
lower during summer and higher during winter. There is
also a less significant semiannual oscillation during 2002–
2005 and 2008. The wavelet spectrogram of MP tempera-
ture shows a statistically less significant annual oscillation
from 2006 to 2009. The phases show that MP temperature is
high during summer and low during winter and the average
amplitude of variation is ±4 K. Also, a statistically less
significant semiannual variation is present during 2004–
2005 and 2007. The phases show that the temperature is
high during equinoxes and low during solstices. The global
power spectra and the Fourier spectra of both MP temper-
ature and altitude show that the annual variation is domi-
nant, followed by the semiannual variation. Figure 5 (top,
middle, and bottom) shows the climatology obtained from
the bimonthly mean altitudes and temperatures of MP, MTI,
and SM, respectively. The MP altitude and temperature in
Figure 5 (top) show annual variations with a lower and
warmer MP in summer and higher and cooler MP in winter.
The presence of a statistically less significant semiannual
variation with maxima during the equinoxes has resulted in
slightly higher temperatures during MA and SO months.
These variations are similar to those observed in the wavelet
spectrograms. The altitude of MP over Gadanki (13.5°N,
79.2°E), a tropical latitude location in India, was also around
98 km, but did not show any significant seasonal variation
and the MP temperature was fluctuating between 178 and
195 K, with no particular seasonal variation [Venkat Ratnam
et al., 2010]. In contrast, MP altitude and temperature over
Taiwan are showing small but significant seasonal varia-
tions. These variations and the amplitudes of variation are in
accordance with the earlier study by Xu et al. [2007].
Similar results were obtained by Chu et al. [2005] over
Maui, Hawaii (20.7°N) for the MP characteristics using the
D00P06
NRLMSIS‐00 model [Picone et al., 2002]. Their results
showed that the MP altitude in winter was around 99 km and
around 96 km in summer, with a smooth transition. Their
observations using a Na lidar, however, showed a summer
minimum of 87.5 km. At Arecibo observatory also, MP
temperature was found to be similar to midlatitude variation
with a winter high and summer low [Friedman, 2003].
It should be remembered that all these observations were
limited to nighttime.
[ 18 ] The altitudes of MTI and SM show statistically sig-
nificant semiannual variations during 2002–2005 and 2009
in Figure 4. SM altitude shows a statistically significant
annual variation only during 2004–2005. The global power
spectra also show that both peaks are prominent in SM
altitude, while only the semiannual peak is prominent in
MTI altitude. The MTI and SM temperatures show statisti-
cally significant annual oscillations almost throughout the
entire period of study. The global power spectra also show
that the annual oscillation is the most dominant. An inves-
tigation of the phases shows that both temperatures are high
during winter and low during summer, and this seasonal
variation is exactly opposite to that seen in MP temperature.
Figure 5 also shows that the MTI and the SM temperatures
are high during winter and low during summer, in accor-
dance with the results obtained from the wavelet analysis.
The altitudes show a semiannual variation with maxima
during MA and SO months. Wavelet analysis also showed
the same results. The SM temperature over Gadanki also
showed similar seasonal behavior and the SM altitude, while
showing a semiannual variation, peaked during the solstices
[Venkat Ratnam et al., 2010]. However, SM was more
prominent during equinoxes in comparison to solstices. At
midlatitudes, the altitude of SM showed annual variation
with maximum during summer and minimum during winter
[Hauchecorne et al., 1987; Leblanc and Hauchecorne,
1997].
4. Variations in the Subtropical Mesosphere
[ 19 ] Bimonthly climatological profiles obtained by aver-
aging the bimonthly mean profiles of all years are shown in
Figure 6. The profile for JF months shows the actual values
and each successive profile is shifted by 20 K for proper
visualization. The last profile shown by the thick solid line
is the average of all bimonthly mean profiles during the
9 year period. Significant variations can be observed among
the bimonthly profiles with pronounced differences in the
mesosphere and MP. It should be remembered that we have
computed the bimonthly profiles by averaging over all local
times, and in spite of this analysis procedure, the MTI at
around 88 km seems to be a prominent feature in the cli-
matological profiles as well as in the 9 year mean, albeit
with less amplitude. The MTIs are broader and discernible
during equinoxes; narrower and discernible during summer
and not very distinguishable in winter. This is similar to the
climatology observed over Gadanki. However, the clima-
tological mean over Taiwan is different from the long‐term
mean obtained over Gadanki, where the temperature was
nearly constant in the 75–90 km region [Venkat Ratnam et al.,
2010].

mesospheric temperature structure over Taiwan, the devia-

means during the 9 year period. Observe the small inversion
feature at 88 km that is present in all the profiles, including
the 9 year mean profile.
tions of the bimonthly means from the 9 year climatological
mean are computed and shown in Figure 7. Grid lines are
also plotted in Figure 7 to aid the eye. The annual oscilla-
tions seem to be dominant at almost all altitudes. The
temperatures are higher in winter and lower in summer in
the upper mesosphere. At around 95 km, a semiannual
oscillation is present with solstice minima and equinoctial
maxima. Above this altitude, the annual variation is once
again the dominant variation with a phase shift. The tem-
D00P06
peratures are showing the opposite seasonal variation with
cooler winters and warmer summers. To understand these
variations, a least squares fit of 2 year (quasi‐biennial oscil-
lation), 1 year (annual oscillation) and half‐year (semiannual
oscillation) harmonics was performed on the temperature
fluctuations at each altitude. Figure 8 (left and middle) shows
the amplitudes and phases of the three oscillations obtained
from these fits, and Figure 8 (right) shows the correlation
coefficients of the fits as a function of altitude. The fits are
not good at 73.0, 86.0, and 90.5 km. It is important to note
that the amplitude of the annual oscillation is the largest at
all altitudes except around 95 km, where the amplitude of
semiannual oscillation dominates. The phase of the annual
oscillation starts gradually changing at 89 km and under-
goes a shift of 180° by 95 km and remains constant above.
The semiannual oscillation also undergoes phase shifts at
80 and 102 km. Between 80 and 102 km, the semiannual
oscillation shows solstice minima and equinox maxima and
above and below this region it shows the opposite variations.
Also, the correlation coefficient is less than 0.6 from 89 to
95 km, where the phase of the annual oscillation is changing.
Such a phase shift in the annual oscillation was observed by
Chu et al. [2005] over Maui in both observations and model
results. Shepherd et al. [2004] also observed a similar phase
reversal in the semiannual oscillation over equatorial and
tropical latitudes with solstice maxima and equinox minima
at 75 km and the opposite at 87 km. This is similar to the
semiannual phases observed in the present study.
[ 21 ] Over midlatitudes and high latitudes MP is cooler and
around 86 km during summer and warmer and at 95–100 km
during winter [von Zahn et al., 1996; She and von Zahn, 1998;
States and Gardner, 2000; She et al., 2000; Thulasiraman
and Nee, 2002; Xu et al., 2007]. Two processes compete to
define MP and result in such a seasonal variation at these
latitudes. In summer, there is strong adiabatic cooling
caused by the mean upward velocities below ∼91 km and
the annual trend at these heights is cool summer and warm

winter. Above 98 km, there is increased UV absorption
by O 2 during summer resulting in high temperatures and
decreased absorption in winter resulting in low tempera-
tures. Hence, there are two local minima in the temperature,
and MP is defined as the lower of these two. In summer,
adiabatic cooling is very strong and thus, MP drops down to
lower altitudes at ∼87 km, and during winter, the higher‐
altitude minimum in 95–100 km, defines the same [States
and Gardner, 2000]. In comparison, MP altitude over sub-
tropical latitudes is limited to the upper level and unlike the
steady MP at equatorial and tropical latitudes [Xu et al.,
2007; Kishore Kumar et al., 2008; Venkat Ratnam et al.,
2010] the subtropical MP shows significant seasonal varia-
tions albeit with less amplitude. The warm summer and cool
winter MP, is due to the solar energy inputs and is not
affected by the mesospheric dynamics below. However, the
MTI and the SM are affected and hence, we observe the
opposite seasonal variation in their temperatures. This is
supported by the phase reversal observed in Figure 8 at
∼88 km and explains the seasonal variations observed in all
the temperatures in section 3. The adiabatic cooling and
warming processes in the lower altitudes exist at the sub-
tropical latitudes also, but are not strong enough to bring
down the MP.
[ 24 ] 2. MP altitude and temperature show significant
annual variation with lower and warmer MP in summer and
higher and cooler MP in winter. The amplitude of variation
of MP altitude is only ±1.5 km and that of the temperature is
±4 K. This seasonal variation is in phase with the solar flux,
showing that the MP over subtropical latitudes is controlled
by the solar energy inputs.
[ 25 ] 3. MTI and SM altitudes are showing weak semi-
annual oscillations and their temperatures are showing sig-
nificant annual oscillations being high during winter and low
during summer. Such a seasonal variation in the temperature
is the result of adiabatic warming and cooling processes in
the mesosphere that are in opposite phase to the solar energy
inputs.
[ 26 ] 4. A phase jump in the annual variation occurring
between 89 km and 95 km is observed in accordance with
earlier studies. This explains the opposite seasonal varia-
tions in the mesosphere (MTI and SM) temperatures and MP
temperature.

5. Summary
[ 22 ] The temperature structure of mesosphere over Taiwan,
a subtropical station, is investigated using observations by
the SABER instrument onboard the TIMED satellite during
the period from March 2002 to October 2010. The study
reveals some interesting features that are different from
the midlatitudes and high latitudes as well as from the low
latitudes.
[ 23 ] 1. MP altitude is confined to the upper level; the
average altitude is 98.2 ± 1.8 km.
